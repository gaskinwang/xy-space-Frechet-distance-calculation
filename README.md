**Fréchet distance calculation**

With given xy coordinate values for two dotted curves, this function calculates
the Frechet distance—a measure of the dissimilarity between the two curves with
the location and ordering of the dots being considered.

>> Run *frechet.m* to calculate the Frechet distance using **frechet1_2.xlsx**
>> (column A for X1, column B for Y1; column A for X2, column B for Y2) as input,
>> printing the result in Command Window.
